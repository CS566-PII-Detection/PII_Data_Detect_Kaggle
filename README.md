## PII-Detection
Kaggle PII Automated data detection and removal compettion


# Overview
The goal of this competition is to develop a model that detects personally identifiable information (PII) in student writing. Your efforts to automate the detection and removal of PII from educational data will lower the cost of releasing educational datasets. This will support learning science research and the development of educational tools.

Reliable automated techniques could allow researchers and industry to tap into the potential that large public educational datasets offer to support the development of effective tools and interventions for supporting teachers and students.

#Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated on micro F(Beta), which is a classification metric that assigns value to recall and precision. The value of Beta is set to 5, which means that recall is weighted 5 times more heavily than precision.
